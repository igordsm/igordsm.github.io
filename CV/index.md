## Projects

**Frequent testing and feedback** - in partnership with Craig Zilles, Mariana Silva (University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign) and Rafael Corsi (Insper)

In this project we study the effects of adding frequent testing and feedback into a CS1 course using Active Learning. We study both students' ability to solve coding questions and the quality of their solutions, trying to maximize the effort per unit of time that students employ to learn programming. We focus on CS majors.

**Learning the C programming language** - with Rafael Corsi (Insper)

Most courses now introduce programming using high-level languages such as Python or Java.  However, many courses still require low-level languages such as C to fully explore concepts such as memory allocation, hardware access and interfacing with the Operating System. In this project we study how to improve students' experiences when learning the C language.
