When doing functional components this is specially explicit. Your function returns whatever should be displayed by the component and receives a props object containing all the information the components need to render. A component rerenders when some of its props are changed, either because an external component made changes or in response to an event. IMHO, this really helps to organize code and separate concerns. All the logic is written in terms of the components' properties. The GUI is updated in response to changes in the properties in order to synchronize the component state with what is shown on screen. We can also achieve this in Vala using properties and bindings from GLib. In this article we will produce a login screen that validates the username and password fields. All code is available at the part1 folder of the example code in Github . Important : The repo contains many iterations of the code presented in this article. A comment containing the name of the original file is shown at the top of each code listing. Let's start with the basic code to build the form above. This is just standard GTK code: all the ui elements are created in the construct method. The original file ( v1/main.vala ) also contains a Gtk.Application subclass that handles initialization and showing our form. Vala tip : the construct block runs during an object's creation and after named constructors are called. // excerpt from v1.vala class LoginForm : Gtk.Grid { // ...... construct { width_request = 300; margin = 10; column_homogeneous = false; expand = false; valign = Gtk.Align.CENTER; halign = Gtk.Align.CENTER; var username_field = new Gtk.Entry () { hexpand = true, margin = 4 }; var password_field = new Gtk.Entry () { hexpand = true, margin = 4 }; var validation_warning = new Gtk.Label (\"\") { wrap = true, height_request = 50 }; var login_btn = new Gtk.Button.with_label (\"Login\") { expand = false, halign = Gtk.Align.END }; attach (new Gtk.Label (\"Username\"), 0, 0); attach (username_field, 1, 0); attach (password_field, 1, 1); attach (new Gtk.Label (\"Password\"), 0, 1); attach (validation_warning, 1, 2); attach (login_btn, 1, 3); show_all (); } } There's no interactivity in this form yet. In fact, it already starts in an inconsistent state: the Login button is enabled even though block fields are empty. We could fix this simply by setting sensitive=false in login_btn initialization, but we won't. Instead we will create a property called is_valid and bind its value to login_btn.sensitive . Every time one of the values change the other is instantly updated. Bindings can also be created with many values as long as a cicle is not introduced. Let's use this now in our program: first we create a property is_valid and then we use bind_property to bind its value to login_btn.sensitive .

Unfortunately this never happens, so let's add a property username and bind it to username_field.text . When username is set we check if its length is larger than 0 and set is_valid accordingly. // excerpt from v3.vala class LoginForm : Gtk.Grid { public bool is_valid { get; set; default = false; } private string _username = \"\"; public string username { get { return _username; } set { _username = value; if (value.length > 0) { is_valid = true; } else { is_valid = false; } }} construct { // GUI creation code bind_property (\"is_valid\", login_btn, \"sensitive\", BindingFlags.BIDIRECTIONAL | BindingFlags.SYNC_CREATE); bind_property (\"username\", username_field, \"text\", BindingFlags.BIDIRECTIONAL | BindingFlags.SYNC_CREATE); } Run the app and test the new validation: the login button should be disable when the app starts and respond to is_valid . IMHO, the impressive part of this code is that all GUI code is on construct and our logic is written only in terms of properties. When we update the Widget's properties the UI will update in response, so our application state is always consistent. Now the final step is to set validation_error to a meaningful message. We can do this with another property binding. To make code more readble we also refactor all our validation code into a function void validate_form () . // excerpt from v4.vala class LoginForm : Gtk.Grid { public string validation_error { get; set; default = \"\"; } public string username { get { return _username; } set { _username = value; validate_form (); } } //.... construct { // .... bind_property (\"validation_error\", validation_warning, \"label\", BindingFlags.DEFAULT | BindingFlags.SYNC_CREATE); } private void validate_form () { if (_username.length == 0) { is_valid = false; validation_error = \"Empty username\"; return; } is_valid = true; validation_error = \"\"; } And that's it for the username field.

All UI code was written in construct and all logic was represented by setting properties. UI was synchronized with the Widget state by binding properties to child widgets. Although the separation of concerns was nice, the example was too simple. There was only one component (the LoginForm ) and no information was neither (i) sent to other components; or (ii) received from other components. In this article we'll create a second form that receives the validated user from LoginForm to a second form. All the example code for this article is available at the part2 folder in this github repo Our component architecture will be based on the following principle: If two components share a parent, then it's the parent's resposability to connect them into a meaningful flow for the application Let's use this principle to extend the example from the last article and add a UserInfoForm after a succesful sign in. We'll start from the part2/v0.vala file. Dealing with events inside a component Events are a place where UI and logic code seems hard to separate. It's quite natural, for instance, to create a login_btn_click event handler that uses both GUI calls to get information from the UI and properties. Fortunately, Vala also provides us with a very nice way of separating this: lambda functions as event handlers. private void do_login () { // check database and validate login here // GUI calls are forbidden here, only properties and other methods can be used } construct { // .... login_btn.clicked.connect (() => { // extract all info from the UI using GUI calls do_login (); }); } In the lambda event handler we can extract all info from the UI using GUI calls and then pass this information along to a method. Since we can use bindings to link information between properties and GUI elements, the amount of code inside the lambda event handler can be quite small. In fact, it might only treat the event information and pass it on to a method that uses it. Another interesting point is that lambda can ignore arguments and their types, so if we don't use the GEvent that the handler is supposed to receive we can just ignore it in our declaration. This has two advantages: do_login does not receive Gtk.Event (or similar), which means it can be called from anywhere in the code, not only in response to an user generated event. Event handlers often receive different arguments depending on which event they handle. The lambda handler is used to treat this arguments, so do_login is not tied to a single type of event. Sending information out For sending information out of our components we can use signals . For instance, upon succesful login our LoginForm could emit a login_succesful signal that sends a User instance with the currently logged in user info. Now it's up to the parent of LoginForm to receive the signal and connect it to the next part of the application flow. First we modify LoginForm . For now our User class only contains the username property. Also, username is can only be assigned when creating an User instance. class User : Object { public string username { get; construct; } public User (string username) { Object (username: username); } } class LoginForm : Gtk.Grid { public signal void login_succesful (User u); // .... private void do_login() { login_succesful (new User (username)); } } Then we receive this information in our Application class: class Application : Gtk.Application { protected override void activate () { var win = new Gtk.ApplicationWindow (this); var login_form = new LoginForm (); login_form.login_succesful.connect ((u) => { print (\"%s\\n\", u.username); }); win.add (login_form); win.show (); } } The complete code is shown in part2/v1.vala . Intermission: Application mixes UI and logic Our Application class is not following the principles outline in the last article . Let's fix that while we add a new Gtk.Stack to hold our new HelloForm . class HelloForm : Gtk.Grid { construct { expand = true; valign = Gtk.Align.CENTER; halign = Gtk.Align.CENTER; var label = new Gtk.Label (\"Hello (username goes here)\"); attach (label, 0, 0); } } Instead of creating widgets inside Application we introduce a ApplicationWidget , a class with the sole purpose of creating the workflow of data between our components. Our first version is shown below. class ApplicationWidget : Gtk.Stack { construct { // ... var login_form = new LoginForm (); add_named (login_form, \"login_form\"); var hello_form = new HelloForm (); add_named (hello_form, \"hello_form\"); visible_child_name = \"login_form\"; } } The complete code is shown in part2/v2.vala . Our application works exactly the same as before, but now UI is separated from the rest of the app in Application as well. Receiving information from other components For receiving information from the \"outside\" worlds we have two options: regular instance methods or public properties. The advantage of using instance methods is that they can be directly connected to other components' signals. However, we must take care of only updating properties inside it so we don't mix UI and logic. We can also use public properties to receive data from the \"outside world\". Use methods if something besides updating the UI is necessary (i.e. pulling information from the database or the web) Use properties otherwise We add a user property to HelloForm so it can receive the currently logged in user. We then connect the components in our ApplicationWidget : class HelloForm : Gtk.Grid { public User user { get; set; } // ... } class ApplicationWidget : Gtk.Stack { construct { // ... login_form.login_succesful.connect ((u) => { hello_form.user = u; visible_child_name = \"hello_form\"; }); } } The final part of this is to connect a change in HelloForm.user with the UI. A first could be creating a binding between user.username to the label text. This won't work, as we are not changing the username property of user , we are overwritting the whole user object. Our binding must reflect that and listen to changes on the entire user object. Up until this point we only used bindings with the same source and target type. GObject also allows transformation bindings, in which we bind properties with different types and provide a function to transform on type into the other. class HelloForm : Gtk.Grid { public User user { get; set; } construct { // ... bind_property (\"user\", label, \"label\", BindingFlags.DEFAULT, (binding, srcval, ref targetval) => { var user = (User) srcval.get_object (); targetval.set_string(\"Hello, %s!\".printf (user.username)); return true; }); } } Transformation functions receive GLib.Value , so we need to convert to the type of objects we need.

All UI code was written in construct and all logic was represented by setting properties. UI was synchronized with the Widget state by binding properties to child widgets. Although the separation of concerns was nice, the example was too simple. There was only one component (the LoginForm ) and no information was neither (i) sent to other components; or (ii) received from other components. In this article we'll create a second form that receives the validated user from LoginForm to a second form. All the example code for this article is available at the part2 folder in this github repo Our component architecture will be based on the following principle:","title":"Vala reactive programming: part 2"},{"location":"blog/2021-12-24/#if-two-components-share-a-parent-then-its-the-parents-resposability-to-connect-them-into-a-meaningful-flow-for-the-application","text":"Let's use this principle to extend the example from the last article and add a UserInfoForm after a succesful sign in. We'll start from the part2/v0.vala file.","title":"If two components share a parent, then it's the parent's resposability to connect them into a meaningful flow for the application"},{"location":"blog/2021-12-24/#dealing-with-events-inside-a-component","text":"Events are a place where UI and logic code seems hard to separate. It's quite natural, for instance, to create a login_btn_click event handler that uses both GUI calls to get information from the UI and properties. Fortunately, Vala also provides us with a very nice way of separating this: lambda functions as event handlers. private void do_login () { // check database and validate login here // GUI calls are forbidden here, only properties and other methods can be used } construct { // .... login_btn.clicked.connect (() => { // extract all info from the UI using GUI calls do_login (); }); } In the lambda event handler we can extract all info from the UI using GUI calls and then pass this information along to a method. Since we can use bindings to link information between properties and GUI elements, the amount of code inside the lambda event handler can be quite small. In fact, it might only treat the event information and pass it on to a method that uses it. Another interesting point is that lambda can ignore arguments and their types, so if we don't use the GEvent that the handler is supposed to receive we can just ignore it in our declaration. This has two advantages: do_login does not receive Gtk.Event (or similar), which means it can be called from anywhere in the code, not only in response to an user generated event. Event handlers often receive different arguments depending on which event they handle. The lambda handler is used to treat this arguments, so do_login is not tied to a single type of event.","title":"Dealing with events inside a component"},{"location":"blog/2021-12-24/#sending-information-out","text":"For sending information out of our components we can use signals . For instance, upon succesful login our LoginForm could emit a login_succesful signal that sends a User instance with the currently logged in user info. Now it's up to the parent of LoginForm to receive the signal and connect it to the next part of the application flow. First we modify LoginForm . For now our User class only contains the username property. Also, username is can only be assigned when creating an User instance. class User : Object { public string username { get; construct; } public User (string username) { Object (username: username); } } class LoginForm : Gtk.Grid { public signal void login_succesful (User u); // .... private void do_login() { login_succesful (new User (username)); } } Then we receive this information in our Application class: class Application : Gtk.Application { protected override void activate () { var win = new Gtk.ApplicationWindow (this); var login_form = new LoginForm (); login_form.login_succesful.connect ((u) => { print (\"%s\\n\", u.username); }); win.add (login_form); win.show (); } } The complete code is shown in part2/v1.vala .","title":"Sending information out"},{"location":"blog/2021-12-24/#intermission-application-mixes-ui-and-logic","text":"Our Application class is not following the principles outline in the last article . Let's fix that while we add a new Gtk.Stack to hold our new HelloForm . class HelloForm : Gtk.Grid { construct { expand = true; valign = Gtk.Align.CENTER; halign = Gtk.Align.CENTER; var label = new Gtk.Label (\"Hello (username goes here)\"); attach (label, 0, 0); } } Instead of creating widgets inside Application we introduce a ApplicationWidget , a class with the sole purpose of creating the workflow of data between our components. Our first version is shown below. class ApplicationWidget : Gtk.Stack { construct { // ... var login_form = new LoginForm (); add_named (login_form, \"login_form\"); var hello_form = new HelloForm (); add_named (hello_form, \"hello_form\"); visible_child_name = \"login_form\"; } } The complete code is shown in part2/v2.vala . Our application works exactly the same as before, but now UI is separated from the rest of the app in Application as well.","title":"Intermission: Application mixes UI and logic"},{"location":"blog/2021-12-24/#receiving-information-from-other-components","text":"For receiving information from the \"outside\" worlds we have two options: regular instance methods or public properties. The advantage of using instance methods is that they can be directly connected to other components' signals. However, we must take care of only updating properties inside it so we don't mix UI and logic. We can also use public properties to receive data from the \"outside world\". Use methods if something besides updating the UI is necessary (i.e. pulling information from the database or the web) Use properties otherwise We add a user property to HelloForm so it can receive the currently logged in user. We then connect the components in our ApplicationWidget : class HelloForm : Gtk.Grid { public User user { get; set; } // ... } class ApplicationWidget : Gtk.Stack { construct { // ... login_form.login_succesful.connect ((u) => { hello_form.user = u; visible_child_name = \"hello_form\"; }); } } The final part of this is to connect a change in HelloForm.user with the UI. A first could be creating a binding between user.username to the label text. This won't work, as we are not changing the username property of user , we are overwritting the whole user object. Our binding must reflect that and listen to changes on the entire user object. Up until this point we only used bindings with the same source and target type. GObject also allows transformation bindings, in which we bind properties with different types and provide a function to transform on type into the other. class HelloForm : Gtk.Grid { public User user { get; set; } construct { // ... bind_property (\"user\", label, \"label\", BindingFlags.DEFAULT, (binding, srcval, ref targetval) => { var user = (User) srcval.get_object (); targetval.set_string(\"Hello, %s!\".printf (user.username)); return true; }); } } Transformation functions receive GLib.Value , so we need to convert to the type of objects we need.
