I have received my Bachelors and PhD in Computer Science from the [University of São Paulo](http://www.usp.br) at the [Institute of Mathematics and Statistics](http://www.ime.usp.br) under the supervision of profs. [Roberto Hirata Jr](http://www.ime.usp.br/~hirata) and [Nina Hirata](http://www.ime.usp.br/~nina). I also did an internship at the [Institut National des Sciences Appliquées](http://www.insa-rouen.fr/) in Rouen under the supervision of professor [Stéphane Canu](http://asi.insa-rouen.fr/enseignants/~scanu/) in the [LITIS lab](http://litis.insa-rouen.fr/).

Currently I am a lecturer at Insper's [Computer Engineering](https://www.insper.edu.br/graduacao/engenharia-computacao/) course and I also do research as a PosDoc at IAG-USP with prof. Cláudia de Oliveira.

### Research Projects

During my PhD I worked with the estimation of local image operators using Machine Learning techniques with applications to document processing and retina segmentation. My thesis is available at [USP virtual library](http://www.teses.usp.br/teses/disponiveis/45/45134/tde-21082017-111455/publico/tese_final.pdf). Code and other resources about this work are available at [TRIOSlib](http://trioslib.github.io).

A list of publications can be found at [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com.br/citations?user=pC2_nBMAAAAJ&hl=en). Supplementary material for my publications is hosted at my [university website](http://www.vision.ime.usp.br/~igor/). My CV is available at the [Lattes Platform](http://buscatextual.cnpq.br/buscatextual/visualizacv.do?id=K4299566T5).
