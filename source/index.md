I have received my Bachelors and PhD in Computer Science from the [University of São Paulo](http://www.usp.br) at the [Institute of Mathematics and Statistics](http://www.ime.usp.br) under the supervision of profs. [Roberto Hirata Jr](http://www.ime.usp.br/~hirata) and [Nina Hirata](http://www.ime.usp.br/~nina). I also did an internship at the [Institut National des Sciences Appliquées](http://www.insa-rouen.fr/) in Rouen under the supervision of professor [Stéphane Canu](http://asi.insa-rouen.fr/enseignants/~scanu/) in the [LITIS lab](http://litis.insa-rouen.fr/).

Currently I am a lecturer at Insper's [Computer Engineering](https://www.insper.edu.br/graduacao/engenharia-computacao/) course and I also do research as a PosDoc at IAG-USP with prof. Cláudia de Oliveira.

### Research Projects

#### W-operator learning

W-operator learning investigates the use of Machine Learning techniques to estimate local image transformations. Each pixel is processed using only a small window around it. More details about the techniques studied in this area can be found at our tutorial ["Image operator learning and Applications"](http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/7812925/). My thesis is available at [USP virtual library](http://www.teses.usp.br/teses/disponiveis/45/45134/tde-21082017-111455/publico/tese_final.pdf). Code and other resources about this work are available at [TRIOSlib](http://trioslib.github.io).

We have aplied the developed techniques to *Staff removal*, a commmon preprocessing used in Optical Music Recognitions. Typically, algorithms designed speficifically for this task exploit some inherent characteristics of musical documents, such as the presence of large horizontal lines (the staffs) or the expected height of objects. Unfortunately, these assumptions are often violated and existing methods fail.   We have obtained state-of-the-art results with methods that extract all information from a set of segmented training images and show that the result is robust to deformations in the images.

<img src="figures/drive.png" class="project-figure-right"> We also worked with the segmentation of blood vessels in the retine using the [DRIVE dataset](http://www.isi.uu.nl/Research/Databases/DRIVE/). We have developed an approach based on Support Vector Machines and Kernel Approximations that can be applied to both binary and gray-level inputs and tested it for this task. Although our results were state-of-the-art, we have obtained better results than many algorithms developed specifically to solve this problem. 

Preliminary results were presented in [this paper](http://sibgrapi.sid.inpe.br/rep/sid.inpe.br/sibgrapi/2016/07.22.14.26?mirror=sid.inpe.br/banon/2001/03.30.15.38.24&metadatarepository=sid.inpe.br/sibgrapi/2016/07.22.14.26.25)
and more up to date results are shown in [my thesis](http://www.teses.usp.br/teses/disponiveis/45/45134/tde-21082017-111455/publico/tese_final.pdf).
