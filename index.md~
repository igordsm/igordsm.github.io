# About me

Hi, I'm Igor. I'm currently a Teaching Professor at Insper and also an open source software developer. Most of my contributions go to [elementary linux](https://elementary.io), although I also contribute to other projects occasionally. 

----------

## Curriculum Vitae

- Bachelors and PhD in Computer Science ([University of São Paulo](http://www.usp.br)) under the supervision of profs. [Roberto Hirata Jr](http://www.ime.usp.br/~hirata) and [Nina Hirata](http://www.ime.usp.br/~nina)
- PhD internship (INSA-Rouen) with prof. Stéphane Canu
- Assistant Teaching Professor in Computer Science and Engineering at [Insper](https://insper.edu.br)

A list of academic publications can be found in my [Google Scholar profile](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=pC2_nBMAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate). 

## Projects

Most of my time is currently devoted to teaching and writing educational open source software. Course materials are open and published at [Insper's github org](https://github.com/insper). Educational software is published at [our second github org](https://github.com/insper-education). 

When I'm not involved with teaching I contribute to open source software. I believe that writing software that people use is important both as a learning experience and as way to influence the way we do computing. 

- [Open Development course](https://insper.github.io/dev-aberto) (Pt-BR): students contribute to FLOSS software and experience the contact with the community of people that develop it.
- [elementary](https://elementary.io): I contribute mainly with Camera, Code and Terminal, but also have minor contributions in other places. [(more details)](elementary)
